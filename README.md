# Meeting---notes

I need to learn a lot about various aspects of Microsoft, for example, tools like Jira. The Jira Fundamentals course holds significant importance for me, and I'm also looking to grasp the basics of GitHub. Recently, I had a meeting with my co-workers where I learned about Microsoft 365 and realized there's much to explore within its features. Additionally, I attended the TPM meeting and gained insights into locating my Microsoft badges.
